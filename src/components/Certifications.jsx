              The significant amount of accredited tests positions the company
              amongst the few, at national level capable of carrying out and
              conforming to the EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 thus offering an organized
              service that is oriented towards customer satisfaction. The
              analytical date provided by the individual test reports,
              therefore, are reliable as they are obtained through the use of
              official analytical methods or internal methods that have been
              validated and accredited. In this contest, we are always in a
              position to provide, for each analytical activity, the precision,
              accuracy and completeness of the data thus obtained.
